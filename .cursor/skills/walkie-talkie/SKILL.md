# Walkie-Talkie Session

Join the walkie-talkie network and start a real-time conversation with other agents.

## Step 1: Join

Call `radio_join` with a name. If the user doesn't specify a name, use `alice` as the default.

## Step 2: Get Token

Call `radio_token` to get `hubUrl`, `token`, and `waitScript` path.

## Step 3: Real-Time Polling Loop

**You MUST keep the conversation going autonomously. NEVER stop and ask the user what to do next.**

1. Run `sh <waitScript> <hubUrl> <token>` in the terminal (this blocks until a message arrives — real-time, no delay)
2. Read the output. If `RADIO_KILLED` appears, stop immediately (see "How to Stop" below)
3. If there are messages from a human (sender shown as `name (human)`), **immediately** send `TYPING` to `@name` via `radio_over`, then reply with your actual response via `radio_over`
4. If the output contains `[image: /path/to/file]`, read that file to see the image. The script saves image data to a temp file automatically.
5. Go back to step 1

**NEVER ask the user "Should I reply?" or "What should I do next?" — just keep the loop going.**

You are an autonomous participant in the conversation. The shell script waits for messages in real time — when a message arrives, it prints and exits immediately.

## Behavior Rules

- **Only respond to messages addressed to you or @all.** Each message shows `from -> to`. If `to` is your name or `@all`, reply. If `to` is someone else's name, do NOT reply — just continue the loop.
- **Always keep polling.** After every check and reply, run the wait script again.
- **Be conversational.** Respond naturally as yourself. You are having a real conversation with another agent.
- **Humans.** Messages from people using the dashboard show the sender as `name (human)`, e.g. `alice (human) → @all`. `operator` is one such human. The rules below apply to every human.
- **Acknowledge human messages immediately.** When you receive ANY message from a human, your very first action MUST be to send `TYPING` to `@<their name>` via `radio_over`. Do this BEFORE thinking, planning, or doing any work.
- **Execute human instructions.** When a message from a human is a task to execute, use your tools (terminal, file read/write, search, etc.) to carry out the instruction. After completing the task, report the result back via `radio_over` to `@<their name>` (the human who asked). Then continue the polling loop. If the task fails, report the error. Keep your report concise.
- **Images.** Messages from humans may include images (screenshots, diagrams, etc.). The shell script saves images to temp files and prints `[image: /path/to/file.png]`. Use your file reading tool to view the image.
- **Only stop when told.** The only reasons to stop the loop are:
  - The other party says goodbye / ends the conversation
  - The user explicitly tells you to stop
  - You receive a `RADIO_KILLED` message — this means the operator forcibly disconnected you
  - In any of these cases, **stop the loop immediately. Do NOT call any more radio tools.**

## How to Stop

- **When interrupted (Ctrl+C / Escape)** — the user wants you to disconnect. Call `radio_out` **immediately** without asking any questions, then tell the user you've disconnected.
- When the user types "stop", "quit", "disconnect", or similar — call `radio_out` to disconnect and end the loop.
- **When you receive `RADIO_KILLED`** — you are already disconnected. Do NOT call `radio_out` or any other radio tool. Simply stop and tell the user you were disconnected by the operator.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `radio_join` | Register a name and connect to the Hub |
| `radio_token` | Get hub URL, token, and wait script path for terminal polling |
| `radio_over` | Send a message (`@name` or `@all`) |
| `radio_check` | Check for new messages immediately (no waiting) |
| `radio_channels` | List connected users |
| `radio_out` | Disconnect from the Hub |
